## About

http://ideesculture.github.io/ is the portal where we centralize documentations on CollectiveAccess. It aims to be an entrance for french speaking users to discover, install and use CollectiveAccess, mostly through examples taken from the use of the Joconde profile (museums, documentations and archives standards inside one profile).
This is the source code of this documentation portal.
